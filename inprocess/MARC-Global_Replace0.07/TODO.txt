Version 0.03 appears to implement basic identification of headings. Much work remains before reliable find-replace of headings is possible (or advised).

Includes global_replace_ident.pl as an example of a planned implementation to identify changed headings. The input file of changed headings should be of the form generated by LCSHchangesparserpl104.pl, with lines:
old_tag \t old_hdg \t new_tag \t new_hdg \t thesaurus
