MARC::Errorchecks is a collection of error checking subroutines for checking MARC record data against AACR2 cataloging rules (and LCRIs), in addition to MARC21 rules, just as MARC::Lint does. The difference between the two is that MARC::Errorchecks is able to cross field boundaries (for example comparing codes in the 008 vs. the 300 subfields), while Lint (and my other module, MARC::Lintadditions) appear to be limited to single-field checking.
