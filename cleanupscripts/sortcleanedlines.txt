=head2 Description

Sort cleaned lines

Input should be result of fieldextraction.pl.
Works best on file that has already gone through
cleanexport010andgreater.pl or
controlfieldscleaning.pl
since these remove counts at beginning of lines
Sorts lines in input file.

To do: Account for uncleaned files, sorting by leading numbers, 
as integers (so 10 comes after 9, rather than 1)
